This was the playful way that I accepted my offer to become [Khan Academy's](http://khanacademy.org) lead mobile developer.

Story
-----

I'd [been deliberating](http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/90426060477/chasing-the-illustrated-primer) the difficult decision to leave Apple for months, over many hard conversations and much introspection. The night before I had promised Khan Academy an answer, I realized that a simple phone call seemed anticlimactic. So I stayed up all night to make this silly thing instead. I sent them an empty email the next morning with this code attached.

Why this?
---------

I was joining Khan Academy specifically to (try to) define the form for educational content on this rich, highly interactive medium. The whole idea is to make [primers that are dynamic and immersive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Young_Lady%27s_Illustrated_Primer); where [the student's involvement in the material is active](http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/8717186905/second-person-self-awareness); where [learning happens through play and discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms:_Children,_Computers,_and_Powerful_Ideas), not just through listening to prescription. Elements should cry out to be touched and played with. The spirit should be one of joy and messiness.

I wanted to make something that would communicate that feeling, both as a stake in the ground, and as a self-introduction to the folks at Khan Academy who hadn't yet met me or been involved in those discussions. And, well, I only had a night, but this is what I came up with.

There's currently a bug in the Xcode 6 beta that causes builds to fail for projects with special characters in them. This is one such project.
